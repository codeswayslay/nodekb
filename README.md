# NODE KB
Server side CRUD application built with PUG (formerly JADE), Node.JS (Express), JQuery, and Bootstrap.

Also demonstrates how "passport" works for authentication, and how "express-validator" can be used to validate data correctness and display flash messages

**NOTE**: Application uses a MongoDB database. As long as you have one setup and you can point to it in the [config file](https://github.com/teamlead-agbaje/nodekb/blob/master/config/database.js), then you should be fine.
